## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, OpenWeather API

The site was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the OpenWeather API. The OpenWeather API provides numerous weather data points in the API call, giving developers an efficient way to pull together the detailed weather information they need to present for a user. This project was a fun exercise in cherry-picking important data points from a dataset and sharing it with a user effectively.
